<p>Grav supports <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown">markdown</a> so you can do things like this:</p>
<h2>Basic formatting</h2>
<p>Paragraphs can be written like so. A paragraph is the basic block of Markdown. A paragraph is what text will turn into when there is no reason it should become anything else.</p>
<p>Paragraphs must be separated by a blank line. Basic formatting of <em>italics</em> and <strong>bold</strong> is supported. This <em>can be <strong>nested</strong> like</em> so.</p>
