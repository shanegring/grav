<p>From treehouses and igloos, to castles and apartments, Airbnb is home to the most unique, expansive listings. But these options mean nothing if you can’t find what you want in 4.5 million listings, and the opportunity for meaningful host-guest connections is lost.</p>
<p>The Airbnb community is incredibly unique. Guests come with varying preferences, each traveling for a different reason. Host goals vary, and they each bring a distinct perspective—some are entrepreneurs who host full-time, and others list when they’re traveling or want to make money on the side.</p>
<p>No matter the reason for traveling or hosting, the experience should be seamless—for guests to find the listing that’s just right, and for hosts to have every opportunity to accurately represent their place. Herein lies our challenge: To design a system that allows hosts to showcase their homes in a way that attracts guests who will enjoy staying there.</p>
<p>I lead design for Host Success, a team whose mission is to help each host reach their potential. Our team thinks about the challenges our hosts face, and how we can empower them to solve them. Here are two specific design challenges we solved for hosts for the recent Airbnb launch.</p>
<p>Challenge #1: Help hosts better set guest expectations
With so many different options on our platform, every stay in an Airbnb is one of a kind. A challenge we face, however, is that listing pages don’t always provide a clear picture of the home—sometimes information is missing, other times it’s buried deep in the description. This can result in surprises come check-in.</p>
<p>Unclear information hierarchy and guiding questions make it hard for hosts to know what information is important to keep updated, and how to most accurately list their homes. For example, hosts have hundreds of settings to modify—from wifi passcode to neighborhood descriptions—but the product wasn’t indicating when critical information was missing.</p>
<p>Additionally, vague questions from us were causing inaccurate responses from hosts. For example, some hosts list their homes as bed and breakfasts because they serve breakfast in the morning. This inaccuracy isn’t on them though, because we haven’t clearly defined what a bed and breakfast is.</p>
<p>To address these issues, we first defined what information mattered most to capture it in a structured way. Research and data helped us determine what guests need to know while searching—such as privacy information, shared spaces, sleeping arrangements, stairs, check-in and checkout processes, and parking. This informed how we prioritize what to ask hosts.</p>
<p>Given of the number of listing settings, we created a guided flow to walk hosts through the update experience. To make the process as smooth as possible, the team made a few key decisions.</p>
<ol>
<li>Optimize for objectivity. To eliminate the chance of misinterpretation, the Content team created clear definitions for 50+ property types on Airbnb. For example, bed and breakfasts are usually professional hospitality businesses that offer breakfast for guests, with a host who oftentimes lives on the property.</li>
